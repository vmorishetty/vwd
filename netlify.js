NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
==============================================

To deploy this project on Netlify, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new site on Netlify
2. Connect to your GitHub/GitLab repository 
3. Configure the build settings:
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: dist/public
   
4. Add environment variables if needed

NOTE: The server-side code has been adapted to work as Netlify Functions.
The API will be accessible at /.netlify/functions/api/* instead of /api/*,
but the frontend code has been updated to handle this automatically.
